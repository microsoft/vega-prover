"""Group-element commitment operations backed by Sage curve arithmetic.

A Hyrax commitment is a list of group elements (one per matrix row). The verifier
needs four operations on these lists:

* :func:`to_points`   -- decompress a commitment to Sage points (transcript/MSM);
* :func:`msm`         -- ``vartime_multiscalar_mul``: ``sum_i s_i * P_i``;
* :func:`combine`     -- ``combine_commitments``: concatenate the point lists;
* :func:`fold`        -- ``fold_commitments``: element-wise weighted sum.

Inputs may mix :class:`~pyvega.curve.WirePoint` (compressed, lazily decompressed)
and already-decompressed Sage points; :func:`_pt` normalizes either form.
