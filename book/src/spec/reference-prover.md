# A simple reference prover

The preceding specification chapters pin every byte the verifier consumes: the
[encodings](serialization.md), the [transcript schedule](transcript-schedule.md),
the [verifier key](verifier-key.md), and the [proof object](proof-object.md). This
chapter supplies the last piece: a complete, runnable prover. Rather than restate
the procedure in prose, it points at a working implementation.

## The implementation is the specification

The repository ships a small **pure-Python reference implementation** under
[`reference/pyvega`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vega-prover/tree/main/reference).
It omits the performance optimizations in the shipped Rust library — delayed modular
reduction, small-value integer arithmetic, multi-scalar-multiplication caches, and
parallelism — and computes each value in the most direct way. It is slower than
the shipped Rust prover, but its control flow follows the protocol step by step.

A written algorithm can drift from the code it describes; a reference prover
cannot, because it is executed and checked against the shipped Rust verifier. The prose in
this book explains the design and the wire format; the reference prover is the
procedure of record.

## Conformance is mutual acceptance, not byte identity

An honest \\(\mathrm{Vega}\_{\mathrm{MC}}\\) proof is randomized: it carries
commitment blinds and one freshly sampled random masking instance drawn once per
proof (see [Zero-knowledge](../mc/zero-knowledge.md)). Two honest runs on the same
statement therefore emit *different* bytes, and both verify. Conformance between
two implementations is consequently defined at the level of **verifier
acceptance**, in both directions:

- a proof from the shipped Rust prover is accepted by the reference verifier, and
- a proof from the reference prover — under a verifier key that the reference
  setup itself produced — is accepted by the shipped Rust verifier.

The reference implementation establishes both directions on the canonical cubic
example; the mechanics are described in [Conformance and test
vectors](test-vectors.md).

## What the reference covers

The reference implements the entire acceptance path end to end, so an implementer
can read a working counterpart to each specification chapter:

## The worked circuit

To stay self-contained and hand-checkable, the reference proves the tiny cubic
relation \\(y = x^3 + x + 5\\) with \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 15\\) — the same
`CubicCircuit` the Rust test suite uses. Its R1CS has four constraints, yet
proving it drives every phase of the protocol: the in-circuit verifier, both folding
schemes, both sum-checks, relaxed Spartan, and the zero-knowledge opening. An
implementer who reproduces acceptance on this example has therefore exercised every
protocol phase, though only at this fixture's dimensions — two step instances and
single-row witness commitments — not for arbitrary circuits.

Because setup is also implemented in Python (`setup.py` generates the Hyrax
generators by hash-to-curve and serializes the verifier key), the reference runs
with no dependency on the shipped Rust library at all: it performs setup, proving,
and verification itself, and the shipped Rust verifier independently accepts the
result.
