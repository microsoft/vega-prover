# Conformance and test vectors

This chapter describes how an independent implementation demonstrates conformance:
the fixtures it can check against, and the executable gates that establish mutual
acceptance with the shipped Rust prover and verifier.

## What conformance means here

As established in [Scope and the conformance contract](scope.md), an honest proof
is randomized, so conformance is **not** byte equality of proofs. It is verifier
acceptance. Two layers of test make this precise:

1. **Deterministic vectors.** Some artifacts *are* fixed functions of their
   inputs and can be checked byte-for-byte: the parse of a given proof, the
   Fiat--Shamir challenges derived from a fixed transcript, and the verifier-key
   digest. An implementation that disagrees on any of these is non-conformant.
2. **Acceptance gates.** The proof as a whole is checked by running the *other*
   side's verifier and asserting it accepts.

## Deterministic fixtures

The directory
[`reference/fixtures/cubic`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vega-prover/tree/main/reference/fixtures/cubic)
holds vectors for the canonical cubic circuit. The single committed fixture is
`transcript_vector.json`, a frozen Keccak transcript known-answer vector; every
other fixture -- keys, proofs, digests, and `meta.json` -- is git-ignored and
regenerated on demand, because the keys are large and the proofs are randomized
(zero-knowledge). Regenerate them with the commands below before running the
tests on a fresh checkout.

| File | Contents | Regenerate with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `meta.json` | circuit metadata + expected public values (`[15]`) | `cargo test --lib export_cubic_fixtures -- --ignored` |
| `proof.bin` | a real Rust-produced proof (bincode) | `cargo test --lib export_cubic_fixtures -- --ignored` |
| `vk_digest.bin` | the 32-byte verifier-key digest | `cargo test --lib export_cubic_fixtures -- --ignored` |
| `vk.bin` | the Rust verifier key (large) | `cargo test --lib export_cubic_fixtures -- --ignored` |
| `transcript_vector.json` | Keccak transcript known-answer vector (committed) | `cargo test --lib export_transcript_vector -- --ignored` |

The reference implementation checks each deterministic layer against these:

- **Proof parsing** — `test_proof_parse.py` parses `proof.bin` and asserts the
  cursor consumes every byte, confirming the [proof object](proof-object.md)
  layout.
- **Transcript** — `test_transcript.py` reproduces the recorded challenges
  byte-for-byte from the committed `transcript_vector.json`, confirming the
  transcript primitive and value encodings. The full [transcript schedule](transcript-schedule.md)
  is exercised end-to-end by the acceptance gates below.
- **Verifier-key digest** — `test_vk_digest.py` recomputes
  \\(\mathrm{SHA\text{-}256}(D)\\) over the digest stream and matches
  `vk_digest.bin`, confirming the [verifier-key](verifier-key.md) encoding.

## Acceptance gates

Acceptance is checked in both directions.

**Rust prover → reference verifier.** `test_verify.py` runs the reference
verifier on the Rust-produced `proof.bin` and asserts acceptance, recovering the
expected public values. This exercises the entire acceptance predicate — instance
validation, both folds, both sum-checks, relaxed Spartan, the pinned public
values, and the final commitment opening — against bytes the reference did not
produce.

**Reference prover → Rust verifier.** The reference prover emits a proof that the
shipped Rust verifier accepts. Two `#[ignore]` harnesses in the Rust test-suite
(`tests/reference_conformance.rs`) deserialize the Python-produced artifacts and
call the real `verify`:

- `verify_python_proof` — the reference proof against the Rust-exported verifier
  key; and
- `verify_python_standalone` — the reference proof against a verifier key that the
  Python `setup.py` itself generated, so the shipped Rust library plays no part in
  setup, proving, *or* key generation. Only verification is Rust.

Both recover the public value \\(15\\).

## Reproducing the gates

```sh
# deterministic vectors (byte-exact)
python3 reference/tests/test_proof_parse.py
python3 reference/tests/test_transcript.py
python3 reference/tests/test_vk_digest.py

# Rust prover -> reference verifier
python3 reference/tests/test_verify.py

# reference prover self-check, and write the stand-alone fixtures
python3 reference/tests/test_prove_finish.py
python3 reference/tests/test_standalone.py

# reference prover -> Rust verifier (both directions of acceptance)
cargo test --test reference_conformance verify_python_proof      -- --ignored --nocapture
cargo test --test reference_conformance verify_python_standalone -- --ignored --nocapture
```

An independent prover conforms when its proofs pass the same acceptance gate: the
shipped Rust verifier, run on the prover's serialized proof and verifier key,
returns success and the expected public values.

## Dependencies

The reference implementation is pure Python and runs under a stock `python3`
interpreter. Its only third-party dependency is
[`pycryptodome`](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/), used for Keccak-256 in
the transcript; the field, curve, polynomial, encoding, and protocol logic are
implemented directly with Python integers. The base field and the T256 curve live
in `curve.py`, so the arithmetic can be reimplemented against any curve backend
without touching the protocol logic.
