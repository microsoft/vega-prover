# vega-prover: Low-latency client-side ZK proving over signed data

This repository implements the ZK provers of [Vega](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2094). They are used for client-side ZK proving of statements over signed data. We focus on optimizing low ZK proving latency, and on settings where statements are proven repeatedly over the same signed data.

This [blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/vega-zero-knowledge-proofs-for-digital-identity-in-the-age-of-ai/) describes the typical application this library targets.

## Documentation

The [Vega Prover Book](https://microsoft.github.io/vega-prover/) documents how the proof system is designed, walks through its building blocks, and develops an implementable specification of the multi-circuit prover.

## Performance
The prover in this repository is the fastest proof system for client-side ZK proving of statements over signed data: it generates a zero-knowledge proof of age from a typical mobile driver's license of about 2 KB in about 92 ms on a commodity client device. The resulting proof is about 108 KB, and it can be verified in 23 ms. No trusted setup is required. The prover key is 464 KB; it fits comfortably on any phone. For smaller credentials, proving drops to 62 ms, with 83 KB proofs, and 17 ms verification.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We optimize for low ZK proving latency on signed messages typical in practice — not for raw throughput.

The `benches/` directory contains SHA-256 benchmarks using [Criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs). Each benchmark measures setup, prep_prove, prove, and verify times across multiple iterations and thread counts, and reports proof sizes.

```bash
# Single-circuit (SC) prover: SHA-256 over 1 KiB and 2 KiB messages
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo bench --bench sha256_vega_sc

# Multi-circuit (MC) prover: 32 SHA-256 step circuits (2048 bytes total)
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo bench --bench sha256_vega_mc_zkp
```

Override thread counts with `BENCH_THREADS` (comma-separated):

```bash
BENCH_THREADS=1,8 RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo bench --bench sha256_vega_sc
```
